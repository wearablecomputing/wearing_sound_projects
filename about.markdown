In this seminar we will explore textile wearable technologies that interact with electronic sound through body movement. We will be working with electronic textiles and soft circuitry, sound, and interactive gesture recognition using visual programming software Max 8.

Practical introductions will provide you with a basis to investigate these technologies within your own creative practice. Our approach will be hands-on and crafts-based, exploring aesthetics and function with our bodies and textile materials.

The seminar is aimed at Master and “Anpassungs-” students who have experience in textile crafts and/or interaction design, and are curious about creative digital technology and art-tech interdisciplinary inquiry. No previous knowledge in electronics and programming required, but commitment and self-motivated learning are crucial. You will work in interdisciplinary teams.

The first part of the seminar combines introductions and practical exercises with electronic textiles and circuitry. with the technologies we will use. In the second part of the semester you will work in teams on a self-initiated project. During this time we offer tutorials and technical support for textile making and sound interaction for your project.
