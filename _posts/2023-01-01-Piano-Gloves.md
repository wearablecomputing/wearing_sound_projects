With the popularity of smart terminals, wearable electronic devices present a
huge market prospect. Sensors, as one of the core components, will influence the
functional design and future development of wearable devices. Flexible wearable
electronic sensors are thin, light, and portable, with excellent electrical
performance and high integration, making them one of the most sought-after
electrical sensors.
However, in terms of practical applications, flexible wearable electronic sensors
still need to achieve technological breakthroughs in preparation processes,
material synthesis, and device integration. Currently, there are typically two
strategies to achieve stretchability in wearable sensors. The first approach is to
bond a thin conductive material directly to a flexible substrate. The second
approach is to assemble the device using inherently stretchable conductors. This
is usually prepared by mixing a conductive substance into a flexible substrate. In
terms of geometric patterning and device design, mesh structures are used to
enhance further stretchability and adaptability, such as island-bridge structures,
straight bands, and serpentines, which allow the sensor to undergo complex
deformations such as stretching, rotation, and twisting, thereby increasing the
sensorâ€™s sensitivity to external forces. But often, to meet the complex
requirements of flexible electronics with properties such as thinness, transparency,
good flexibility and stretchability, and insulation and corrosion resistance, we
need to integrate different materials, such as rigid conventional inorganic
materials with excellent electrical properties adhered to the surface of a flexible
substrate, or conductive inks printed on silicone-based transparent films. At the
same time, from producing highly sophisticated sensors to their application in
actual wearable products, we also need to integrate these complex electronic
components onto clothing fibers, for example, by heat pressing, stitching, and so
on.
In the first semester of our research we took an elective course, WEARING SOUND,
in which we investigated how to print both conductive TPU and non-conductive
TPU filament with a dual extrusion printer and make a sensor with stable
resistance changes. with the support of these techniques we made a glove-like
musical instrument and used it in MAX 8 and Machine Learning to prototype the
instrument.
To simplify the complex production process and material selection, is it possible to
apply 3d printing technology to the integrated production of flexible wearable
smart fabrics, thus reducing the number of production steps? Thus, we try to
integrate only conductive TPU with non-conductive TPU using 3d printing and test
the sensitivity of these elastic sensors through different microstructures to create
a smart sensor collection that can capture movements. And in the whole wearable
music simulator system, how can the structure and wearing style be designed so
that the two sensors of pitch and volume can be controlled to better collect
human movement data? This will be the design focus of the solution we need to
give in the next 6 months.
