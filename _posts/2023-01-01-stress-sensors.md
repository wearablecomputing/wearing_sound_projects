stress sensors are four sensors located on the body, in places that I touch when I am stressed. These scratching and massaging movements on the ear, back, chest and thumb are measured by receptive sensors and transferred into sound. Thus, small movements that I make every day but do not notice are brought to consciousness.
The physical as well as psychological wear and regeneration of the body and skin due to stress is transferred to the behavior of the sound. The number of times a sensor is touched controls the volume of the sample the sensor is connected to. If the sensor is touched several times within a certain time interval, the volume of the sound will amplify. If the sensor is not touched within the time interval, the volume decreases.
Thus, the sensors and the samples connected to them can wear out and regenerate like the skin and the body is experiencing stress.
The sensors are felted non-conductive and conductive wool. The felted sensors have then been covered with dyed bioplastic made from corn starch. The shapes of the sensors blend with the body and have the feel of a second skin. The sensors of the back and the chest are connected with paracords and form a kind of harness. The sensor on the thumb is attached to a plexiglass ring and the one on the ear is attached by a pin. The connection cables from the sensors to the microcontroller are paracords with copper wire as inner part. The sensors, the cables and the connecting parts between the sensors together form a unified assesoir.
