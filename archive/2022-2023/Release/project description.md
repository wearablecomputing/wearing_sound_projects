## Project description

I think the relationship between gesture and sound is like the relationship between stimulus
and response, input and output. The gesture gives a stimulus to the sensor, and the sound
amplifies the stimulus. The stimulation of the environment and people to the fabric is
sometimes implicit and sometimes explicit, the sound amplifies the stimulation received by
the fabric as a signal that our senses can feel.
This project of mine is an art performance. The sensor I am using is a gravity sensor. I
design clothes with lots of pockets, and each pocket holds a heavy item. When heavy
objects are put into the pockets and taken out of the pockets, the gravity sensor makes
different sounds by pulling the piezoresistive yarns. Different pockets on clothes represent
different meanings.
The clothes are composed of 5 parts, namely: the outermost black top with larger right
wing, the inner black top with left smaller wing, the innermost light gray top with sleeves,
dark gray suspender dress, the innermost black mopping dress below. The pocket of the
outermost black top with the larger wing on the right represents atmospheres. The pocket
of the inside black top with the smaller wing on the left represents potentials. The pocket
of the innermost sleeved light gray top represents emotions. The pocket of the dark gray
suspender dress represents energies. I designed 3 scenes. In the first scene, the model is
wearing clothes with many layers. In the second scene, the model takes off the outermost
black top with the larger wing on the right. In the third scene, the model removes the black
top with the smaller wing on the left. Putting a heavy object in and out of the pocket
represents the application and release of pressure. Through the change of the sound made
by the clothes, we can feel the changes of atmospheres and people's emotions, energies,
and potentials.
I want to express the relationship between people and space through the different sounds
conveyed by different pockets. As the space and atmospheres changes, people's emotionsï¼Œ
energies and potentials will also change. People will also change their emotions under
different pressures. This art performance also wants to convey that people pay attention to
the emotional changes brought about by the high-intensity pressure of modern society.
People decompress stress and adapt to the rhythm of life in a way that suits them.
I think the role of wearable technology is to draw more attention to the fabric itself and the
relationship between clothing and the human body. While people's activities have an
impact on the clothes, the clothes also rub against the skin and have an impact on the
human body. This impact is mutual. In my opinion, clothing is living works of art with the
body as the carrier. Wearable technology makes clothes more closely related to people.
Clothes are alive, breathing, and interacting with people. Wearable technology makes
wearing clothes more interesting and at the same time make people think seriously about
the vitality and tension of clothing.
